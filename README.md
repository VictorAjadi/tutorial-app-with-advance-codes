# tutorial-app-with-advance-codes
This is a tutorial app where courses can be bought for paid courses and for the free just clicking on an enroll button enroll's student into the course, it has autopayment for intructors at the end of the month with strong authenticated video url prevent student, authorized users and unauthorized to download the video, but rather watch.

So to run the frontend only you can simply
1. `cd frontend`
2. `npm run dev` // do expect errors cause this is separated from the backend

So to run the full app you can simply
1. `cd backend`
2. `npm run dev` // this will run developer mode where the stack trace of all errors are fully show, not customized errors(user friendly errors)
3. `npm run prod` // this will run production mode where only customized errors(user friendly errors) are shown but due to the use of spdy this runs only on https
